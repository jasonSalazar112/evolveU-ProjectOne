Project: Choose Your Own Adventure - 007 Movie Trivia

Description:
This is my first coding project for evolveU.  The theme is "Choose Your Own Adventure".
I attribute this project to my passion for movies, especially the James Bond franchise.
I have always felt like I was on an adventure while watching films.
Enjoy.
